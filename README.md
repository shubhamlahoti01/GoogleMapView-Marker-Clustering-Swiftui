## 🗺️ SwiftUI + Google Maps: Dynamic Marker Clustering

From city lights to micro-sites 🌆➡️🔍 — this project showcases a **SwiftUI-powered Google Maps integration** with intelligent, dynamic marker rendering and clustering.

### ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Markers**: Zoom in for detailed markers, zoom out to see them intelligently clustered.
* **Custom Marker Views**: Each marker shows a circular image (or fallback text) with a green border when selected.
* **Interactive Selection**: Tap to select/deselect a marker — visual feedback with green border highlight.
* **Live Marker Updates**: Easily append new markers via API calls — they instantly reflect on the map.
* **Efficient Rendering**: Uses diffing logic to avoid redrawing unchanged markers, resulting in a smooth and optimized user experience.

### 🔧 Built With

* **SwiftUI**
* **Google Maps SDK for iOS**
* **Custom UIViewRepresentable Map Integration**
* **Marker Clustering via GMUClusterManager**
